# Hey! 


[![LinkedIn][linkedin-shield]][linkedin-url]

I am a PhD student at the [Insitute of Cancer Research](https://www.icr.ac.uk/). Under the supervision of [Professor Chris Bakal](https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/researchers-and-teams/professor-chris-bakal), I am researching multimodal AI for predicting cancer patients' diagnosis and treatment response. My PhD is part of the NIHR BRC [Studentship]([https://mach3cancer.org/](https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/academic-career-development/current-opportunities/phd-studentships-2023/)) award.
